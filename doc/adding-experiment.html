<h3>Instructions</h3>
</div>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Select a "project" for the experiment to live in.  The project determines the value of the <code>category</code> field in each post related to the experiment.</li>
	<li>Select an experiment name (e.g., "foo").  All notes or posts for the experiment should carry a category of the format <code>experiment:experiment-NAME</code>.</li>
	<li>Add a section to the <code>experiments.html</code> page, with an iterator over the posts for your experiment category.</li>
</ul>

The end result is that your experiment's posts will show up as a group on the main experiments page, they'll show up by clicking on the tag itself in the tag cloud listing, and the experiment's posts will show up as part of the overall project's listing.
