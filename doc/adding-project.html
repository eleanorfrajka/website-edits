<p>
A project is composed of two elements.  First, a project has a description page, which gives a brief overview of the project itself, as well as providing a time-sorted listing of posts and notes related to the project.  Second, each project then has a sequence of lab notes and posts, which are controlled by the use of the post <code>category</code> field.  A project category has the form: <code>project:NAME</code>.  

Tags are used to further classify posts within a project, allowing one to have different experiments, reading notes, analyses, and so on.  

To create a new project:

<ul>
	<li>Create a directory for the project under <code>/projects</code>.  The directory name is not important except that it will be in the URL in the nav bars.</li>

	<li>Add an <code>index.html</code> page to the project directory.  This page should have the standard Jekyll metadata header, and use <code>project_layout</code> as the layout.  </li>

	<li>This page can then include arbitrary HTML to describe the project, link to outside materials, etc.  At the bottom of this project page, you should include a Jekyll block to iterate over the posts in <code>site.categories["category-name"]</code>.  Any existing project page has an example.</li>

	<li>Include the project page in the layouts for <code>default.html</code> and <code>project_layout.html</code> so that it shows up in the navigation bars on all pages.  </li>
</ul>
