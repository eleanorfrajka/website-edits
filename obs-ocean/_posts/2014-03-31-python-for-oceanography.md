### Getting Started with Python on a Mac, for Matlab-ers

  1. **Installation**: If you don&#8217;t use Macports, then first install Macports following [these instructions][1]. Macports is a &#8220;package manager&#8221; for Mac, similar to Fink. 
      * **Get Python packages for data analysis**: Python comes installed on a Mac, but for some of the Matlab-like packages, you probably want the `scipy` &#8220;stack&#8221; or collection of packages. See the short version of how to install it using Macports [here][2]. or the longer, original here: <http://www.scipy.org/install.html>. (If you don&#8217;t already use Macports, then start .)
      * **The user interface**: An interactive development environment (IDE) which is similar to the Matlab user interface is Spyder. You can follow the installation instructions <https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/wiki/Installation>, but I used the `*.dmg` disk image file for installation (though they also describe the Macports installation). </ol> 
    ### Online tutorial
    
      1. **[learnpython.org][3]** &#8211; This is a great tutorial that you can use EVEN BEFORE you install python on your computer. It has a little coding window at the bottom of the page. As a tip though, there isn&#8217;t much space to read the webpage and edit the coding on a 13&#8243; Macbook, so best viewed on a larger screen.
      2. **Matlab vs NumPy** are compared here: [http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy\_for\_Matlab_Users][4]. </ol> 
        ### Compilations of Resources for oceanographers:
        
          1. An oceanography specific: <http://www.imr.no/~bjorn/python/links.html>
          2. Or even more so: <https://code.google.com/p/sea-py/wiki/SEAPY>
          3. A community for oceanographers using python? <http://oceanpython.org/>
