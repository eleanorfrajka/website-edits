These posts are a collection of tools to access various oceanographic (and atmospheric) datasets online.

They&#8217;re roughly organised into three categories:

  * [Satellite data][1] &#8211; including satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), ocean color, winds, and sea surface height,
  * [In situ data][2] &#8211; such as hydrographic databases and Argo profiling float data,
  * and various [Other datasets][3] &#8211; anything that doesn&#8217;t fit into the above categories: bathymetry data, and reanalysis surface fluxes.

You can access them from the links above, or browse the categories and tags in the sidebar on the right.
