Below are some self-paced labs to work through in order to learn to use Matlab.

See the [Matlab filebase][1] for the necessary files. These are password protected since they&#8217;re primarily for students in SOES3016.

As of Jul 2013, the labs are as follows.

  1. Lab A: Matlab vs Excel
  2. Lab B: Figures
  3. Lab C: Curve fitting
  4. Lab D: Harmonic fits
  5. Lab E: Working with 3-d matrices
  6. Lab F: Climatologies
  7. Lab G: Vector (velocity) data
  8. Lab H: Spatial display of timeseries information
  9. Lab I: Unevenly spaced data
