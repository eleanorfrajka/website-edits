Measurement methods include traditional ship-based observations, as well as autonomous float and glider platforms. Below are a collection of oceanographic data sets (primarily for physical oceanography) that are freely available online. I&#8217;ve recorded the steps I&#8217;ve taken to access the data, and in some cases, Matlab scripts or functions to parse the data into Matlab.

> If the code or instructions below are helpful to you, I&#8217;d love to hear it. Always nice to know whether it&#8217;s worthwhile to put these kinds of instructions online. Even better, if you encounter and fix a relevant data-access issue that isn&#8217;t in the &#8220;troubleshooting&#8221; below or know a better way to access the data, let me know so I can add it to the page.

  1. **Autonomous floats** &#8211; The Argo float array currently has over 3000 floats profiling the world&#8217;s oceans every 10 days. Data are quality controlled by the independent Argo centres and float profile data are available in near real-time. Find [steps to access Argo hydrographic data][2].
  2. **Float trajectories** &#8211; Argo floats are carried by ocean currents at their parking depth (ranging from 1000-2000 dbar, depending on the float) for 9+ days before surfacing to make their profile and transmit data to centres on land. The displacements between successive profiles have been processed into float trajectory information. One such trajectory product is [YoMaHa &#8217;07][3]
  3. **Multi-source hydrographic database** &#8211; A lot of data is compiled into the [World Ocean Database][4], from ship-based surveys, autonomous floats, gliders and more. These data are freely available to download.
