Below are a collection of oceanographic data sets (primarily for physical oceanography) that are freely available online. I&#8217;ve recorded the steps I&#8217;ve taken to access the data, and in some cases, Matlab scripts or functions to parse the data into Matlab.

> If the code or instructions below are helpful to you, I&#8217;d love to hear it. Always nice to know whether it&#8217;s worthwhile to put these kinds of instructions online. Even better, if you encounter and fix a relevant data-access issue that isn&#8217;t in the &#8220;troubleshooting&#8221; below or know a better way to access the data, let me know so I can add it to the page.

### Other data products

  1. **Bathymetry**, at 1 minute resolution from ETOPO. See [steps to access data][2].
  2. **Surface fluxes/Winds/temperatures** from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 2. See [steps to access data product][3].
  3. **Surface fluxes/Winds/temperatures** from ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. See [steps to access data product][4].
  4. **Florida Current transport**. The Florida Current (the Gulf Stream between Florida and the Bahamas) has been estimated from voltage differences across a disused submarine telephone cable since 1982. See [steps to access data][5]. Data are available daily, but have been processed with a 3-day filter.
  5. **Gridded hydrography** from the World Ocean Atlas, a global climatology of monthly hydrographic (and other) data fields. See [steps to access][6].
