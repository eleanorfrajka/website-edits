These pages are loosely maintained by <a href="http://www.eleanorfrajka.com">Dr. Eleanor Frajka-Williams</a>, a physical oceanographer and lecturer at the University of Southampton, National Oceanography Centre in the UK. These resources used to live on my personal website, but I have relocated them here to separate my own research and teaching from these tools which may be of interest to the wider community. Please send me an <a href="mailto://eleanorfrajka@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or use the contact page if you find something is not working or have a suggestion.
