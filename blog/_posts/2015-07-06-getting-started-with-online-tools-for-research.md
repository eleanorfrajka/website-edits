## Online tools for researchers

There are a great many online tools for researchers.  Where to begin?  For an extensive list, see [http://connectedresearchers.com/online-tools-for-researchers/](http://connectedresearchers.com/online-tools-for-researchers/).   But if you want to get started with just a few, rather than trawling through all the possibilites, read below.  This post necessarily has an oceanographic focus, as some of the tools with a 'community' attached will only be useful if others in your field also use them.

# If you're just getting started...

### For new students (without any publications)

- **Reference manager**.  The most essential tool starting out is a reference manager, to organise all those papers you'll be reading.  Check with your advisor, or I'd suggest starting with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com).  It is platform independent (i.e. runs on Mac and Windows) and free to start.  Make an account, install the browser plugin (to add citation information when you browse across an interesting article), and get the desktop version to manage your references on your computer.  You can also browse for groups focused on your research topic as a good way to find additional references.

- **Social media (optional)**. If you're savvy with social media, consider getting started with [Twitter](http://twitter.com).  Read this post about getting started [Twitter-for-Academics](https://onlineacademic.wordpress.com/social-media-for-academics/twitter-for-academics/).  Search for a few oceanographic institutions to follow their news, and then let Twitter make some suggestions for who else you might like to follow.
    - [@WHOImedia](https://twitter.com/WHOImedia)
    - [@NatureClimate](https://twitter.com/NatureClimate)
    - [@ClimateSnack](https://twitter.com/ClimateSnack)
    - [@EGU_Ocean](https://twitter.com/EGU_Ocean)
    - [@Scripps_Ocean](https://twitter.com/Scripps_Ocean)
    - [@NOCnews](https://twitter.com/NOCnews)
_Note: There are two mindsets about social media & work--one where you keep personal and work-related social media separate and one where you let them mix.  It's worth thinking a little about this before diving in._

- **Academic network (optional)**.  Another place you might get started with a social-media type network for academics is [ResearchGate](researchgate.net). Again, create a free account, then search for people (authors of papers relevant to your work) and 'follow' them.  ResearchGate becomes more useful when you have a few papers of your own, but in the meantime you can use it to keep up-to-date with the work of people in your field (assuming they have a ResearchGate account!).

### After you've given a talk or poster at a conference 

After you've given a talk but before your work has appeared in print, you can still share your research outputs.  However, _check with your advisor first that they're happy for you to post slides/posters online!_

- **Upload your research media (optional - check with advisor!)**
    - For a talk, create a free account at [Slideshare.net](slideshare.net) and upload your slides.  Then, if you created a Twitter account above, send a tweet about your slides also using the hashtag associated with the conference.
    - For a poster, create a free account at [figshare.com](figshare.com) and upload the poster.  Add a bit of useful text to help people find it, and then (if you created a Twitter account above) send a tweet about the poster.
- **Create a professional website (optional)**.  This is more work than the Google Scholar or ResearchGate recommendations, but those web-outlets are primarily for publications in citable literature.  If you're just starting out, or even finishing your PhD, you may not have an extensive publication list.  However, if you're finishing your PhD and on the job hunt, it can be useful when attending conferences to have an online presence so that people can find out more about you/get your contact information.  A website also serves as a central hub for all these other online resources.  

One of the easiest (and free) ways to set up a personal/work website is through [https://wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com).  Working with different templates, you can create a static site (rather than a blog-style site).  _Alternate: If you're more tech savvy, or already use GitHub for your research, check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)._

A basic website will likely include:
    - Contact information (e-mail-at a minimum, and possibly a work-postal address)
    - Your role and Affiliation (e.g., _PhD student in Physical Oceanography at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK_)
    - Links to any of your uploaded research media or social networks (associated with work)
    - Publications (if any).  You can include conference publications.
    - CV (optional).  If you're on the job-hunt, seeking out postdocs, it may be a good idea to have your CV online so that people can easily find it.



### Once you have 1 or 2 papers under your belt

- **Create an ORCID**.  An [http://orcid.org](http://orcid.org) allows your publications to be uniquely identified with you.  (Particularly useful if you have a more common name.)  Some of the above services will also let you link with your ORCID.
- **Citation tracker**. Create a free [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) account.   Set up your account, then populate the page with your paper(s).  Check out their notification settings to receive an e-mail when someone cites your work.  You can also find a few researchers on there in related fields and 'follow' their work.  
    - _Benefits:_ Google scholar profiles come up in google searches!  
    - _Downsides:_ Google scholar profiles primarily serve as a publication list since they don't have a way for you to contact or otherwise interact with the person. So, while it puts you online, it doesn't offer people a way to find you or interact with you.
- **Web presence (optional)**.  Another way to make your work visible is using [ResearchGate](researchgate.net), mentioned above.  Once you have a couple papers, you can include the bibliographic information here. Just be careful of uploading full-text PDFs of the articles in case you don't have the rights to it.
