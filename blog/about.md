This is an experiment in setting up an Open Science lab book.

- Slowly editing from the [Jekyll-lablog](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog).

1. Cloned it via git 
2. Installed [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
3. Changed into the directory and ran 

        jekyll serve

4. Opened browser and navigated to `localhost:4000`

### Updated for myself: ###
- CSS styles
    - Color choices in  `css/main.scss`  using some lovely colors from [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org)
    - Changed fontsizes, also in `css/main.scss`
- Layouts
    - Changed the order and size of post links in `post.html`
