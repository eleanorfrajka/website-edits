	abstract={The ocean conveyor is a term used to describe how a parcel of water initially at the
surface in high northern latitudes might travel at depth to the Southern Ocean, and then
return in surface currents (see Figure 1). The conveyor belt idea made its Hollywood
debut in the film ‘The Day after Tomorrow’ in which a palaeoclimatologist shows a similar
diagram to politicians. Soon after, large drops in temperature are recorded by weather
buoys off Greenland — a warning that the world is undergoing a massive climate shift
due to a shut down of the conveyor belt. In the film, the shutdown of the circulation
plunged the world into a new ice age, with glacial conditions spreading equatorward
more quickly than cars could drive. While the details of the film are only loosely based
on science, it raises a valid question: could the conveyor shut down and what would be
the consequences to the Earth climate system if it did?}

	year = 2011,
	abstract={This report describes the mooring operations conducted during RV Knorr cruise KN200-4 between 13 April and 3 May 2011. \\ These mooring operations were completed as part of the United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) funded RAPID-WATCH Programme to monitor the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) at 26.5°N. The primary purpose on this cruise for the UK team was to service the RAPID Western Boundary moorings while the US teams worked on the Western Boundary Time Series project and the RAPID-MOCHA Western Boundary moorings.\\
Cruise KN200-4 was from Port Everglades, Florida to Port Everglades, Florida and covered the Western Boundary moorings deployed on RB0901 and OC459. This cruise was the ninth annual refurbishment of the Western Boundary section of an array of moorings deployed across the Atlantic in order to continuously observe the MOC. This array will be further refined and refurbished during subsequent years.\\
The instruments deployed on the array consist of a variety of current meters, bottom pressure recorders, and CTD loggers, which, combined with time series measurements of the Florida Straits Current and wind stress estimates, will be used to determine the strength and structure of the MOC at 26.5°N.}

	journal = jpo,
	volume= 44,
	issue = 1,
	pages = {220--228},
	year = 2009,
	doi= {10.6084/m9.figshare.1473116},
	abstract = {The Labrador Sea is a critical region in the world’s ocean: a region where the effects of climate change are seen quickly and strikingly, and where dynamic processes that affect climate change are observed. A recent effect of climate change is the increase of freshwater to high latitudes, as Arctic pack ice and Greenland glaciers melt at accelerating rates. In times of rapid climate change, it is more important than ever to understand the influence these changes have on the status quo of ecosys- tems and physical processes. The focus of this thesis is to examine the current state of the Labrador Sea biological and physical system through in situ Seaglider and surface satellite observations. The influence of physical processes, including increased freshwater runoff, on the biological system is the subject of chapters 2 and 3. The deep convective process, one of the downwelling branches of the global oceanic overturning circulation is the subject of chapters 4 and 5. Seaglider is capable of making novel measurements of vertical water velocity to better than 1 cm s−1 accuracy. Using these measurements along with hydrographic observations, we describe deep convection during the 2004-05 winter. Besides the scientific merits of the results shown here, this thesis also demonstrates the ability of Seaglider to observe bio-optical properties and vertical velocities, two relatively newer observations in the oceanography literature.}

Enthusiasm and doubt surrounded the junior women at the opening reception of the Pattullo Conference. As in other sci- ence and engineering fields, real and per- ceived challenges prevent many women from continuing careers in physical oceanography after graduate school, and we were gathered with senior scientists in the field to debunk the myths surround- ing academic careers and help junior women understand the real challenges. Topics at the conference ranged from balancing work and family life to success- fully funding research proposals. In this article, we—junior scientist attendees— share some of our personal revelations, surprises, and perspectives about women in physical oceanography gained from this conference. We hope this article
will provide insight into the benefits of a gender-specific mentoring event such as the Pattullo Conference, inform senior scientists about what they can do to strengthen the field for junior scientists, and provide guidance to our peers in all geosciences about their chosen careers.}

	year = 2005,
	abstract = {Bispectral analysis of the nonlinear resonant interaction known as parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) for a coherence semidiurnal internal tide demon- strates the ability of the bispectrum to identify and quantify the transfer rate. Assuming that the interaction is confined to a vertical plane, energy equations transform in such a way that nonlinear terms become the third-moment spectral quantity known as the bispectrum. Bispectral transfer rates computed on PSI in an idealized, fully-nonlinear, non-hydrostatic Boussinesq model compare well to model growth rates of daughter waves. Bispectra also identify the nonlinear terms responsible for energy transfer. Using resonance conditions for an M2 tide, the locus of PSI wavenumber triads is determined as a function of parent-wave fre- quency and wavenumbers, latitude and range of daughter-wave frequencies. The locus is used to determine the expected bispectral signal of PSI in wavenumber space. Bispectra computed using velocity profiles from the HOME experiment are relatively noisy and the signal inconclusive.}

	title = {Convection in a Fluid Loop},
	url = {http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=21370&pt=10&p=17273},
	abstract = {Sandstrom’s conjecture states that a closed steady circulation can only be maintained in a fluid body if the heating is applied at a lower level than the cooling. In the ocean this has been taken to mean that there can not be a purely buoyancy-driven circulation since the pri- mary sources of heat and salt are applied at the surface. Using the one-dimensional fluid loop of Welander with boundary condition of temperature relaxing to warm and cold at the same geopotential, we find that Sandstr\:om’s conjecture holds; circulation and horizontal heat trans- port all vanish as the Rayleigh number R −→ ∞ (the limit relevant for the ocean). However, if we specify fixed temperature flux boundary conditions, then contrary to Sandstrom’s conjec- ture, circulation does not vanish as R −→ ∞. Thus Sandstrom’s conjecture is sensitive to the particular choice of boundary conditions specified. In the case of the ocean, where salinity and sensible heat also play a role in forcing the system, it is not clear that fixed temperature rather than fixed flux boundary conditions at the surface are appropriate.
This system of horizontal convection in a loop is stable, but becomes chaotic as the heat sources are rotated from horizontal to vertical positions (heating at the bottom and cooling at the top). We determine the orientation of the heating and cooling at which this transition to chaos occurs. We also show how the strength of the circulation responds to different positioning of heating and cooling.
