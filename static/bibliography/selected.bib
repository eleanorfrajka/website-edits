	abstract = {Climate simulations predict a slowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC), a key oceanic component of the climate system, while continuous observations of the MOC from boundary arrays demonstrate substantial variability on weekly to interannual time scales. These arrays are necessarily limited to individual latitudes. A potential proxy for the MOC covering longer time scales and larger spatial scales is desirable. Here we use sea surface height data from satellites to estimate the interannual variability of transbasin ocean transports at 26°N. Combining this estimate with surface Ekman transport and cable measurements of the Florida Current, we construct a time series of the MOC from 1993 to 2014. This satellite-based estimate recovers over 90% of the interannual variability of the MOC measured by the RAPID 26°N array. This analysis complements in situ observational efforts to measure the MOC at multiple latitudes and opens the door to a broader spatial understanding of the Atlantic circulation variability.}

	journal = phil,
	volume = 372,
	issue = 2025,

	abstract = {Sustained observations of ocean properties reveal a global warming trend and rising sea levels. These changes have been documented by traditional ship-based measurements of ocean properties, whereas more recent Argo profiling floats and satellite records permit estimates of ocean changes on a near real-time basis. Through these and newer methods of observing the oceans, scientists are moving from quantifying the ‘state of the ocean’ to monitoring its variability, and distinguishing the physical processes bringing signals of change. In this paper, I give a brief overview of the UK contributions to the physical oceanographic observations, and the role they have played in the wider global observing systems. While temperature and salinity are the primary measurements of physical oceanography, new transbasin mooring arrays also resolve changes in ocean circulation on daily timescales. Emerging technologies permit routine observations at higher-than-ever spatial resolutions. Following this, I then give a personal perspective on the future of sustained observations. New measurement techniques promise exciting discoveries concerning the role of smaller scales and boundary processes in setting the large-scale ocean circulation and the ocean's role in climate. The challenges now facing the scientific community include sustaining critical observations in the case of funding system changes or shifts in government priorities. These long records will enable a determination of the role and response of the ocean to climate change.}

abstract = {Deep convection—the process by which surface waters are mixed down to 1000 m or deeper—forms the primary downwelling of the meridional overturning circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. High-resolution hydrographic measurements from Seagliders indicate that during deep convection—though water is well mixed vertically—there is substantial horizontal variation in density over short distances (tens of kilometers). This horizontal density variability present in winter (January–February) contains sufficient buoyancy to restratify the convecting region to observed levels 2.5 months later, as estimated from Argo floating platforms. These results highlight the importance of small-scale heterogeneities in the ocean that are typically poorly represented in climate models, potentially contributing to the difficulty climate models have in representing deep convection.}}
