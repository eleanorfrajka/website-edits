## PhD projects at the National Oceanography Centre

Projects are advertised throughout the year, but the primary application period is in January each year. If you’re interested in working with me, please plan to apply to the Graduate School at the National Oceanography Centre, and also send me an e-mail with your CV and a brief statement of interests, so I know to look for your application. The application deadline is typically early in the year, with interviews running between February and April. See more information at the [application page for Ocean and Earth Sciences](http://www.soton.ac.uk/soes/postgraduate/research_degrees/apply.page?).

* Projects in the [Physical Oceanography and Climate](http://noc.ac.uk/gsnocs/projects/Projects%20by%20Research%20Group/Physical%20Oceanography%20and%20Climate) group

## Postdoctoral opportunities

I don’t presently have any postdoctoral positions advertised. However, independent fellowships exist for postdocs from the US or UK.

* You can apply to the **Natural Environment Research Council** for an independent fellowship to work in Southampton. Applications are typically due once a year.
See more details at
[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/fellowships/irf/](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/fellowships/irf/)

* For US citizens/nationals/permanent residents, you can also apply for a postdoctoral fellowship from **NSF** to come to England. The deadline in 2014 was in December, so is likely to be this time of year in the future.

## Undergraduate/Masters opportunities

I supervise up to 3 or 4 student projects each academic year, among MSc, MOcean and BSc projects. I start discussing topics around Jan-Feb each year, when MSc students start looking for projects. If you are an MSc or MOcean student, this is a good time to contact me about projects. If you are a BSc student, this is also a good time to talk to me about projects, though you will not typically select projects until later in the year. For a successful project, you will need to know how to use Matlab or some other programming language.

To get an idea of projects I have supervised in the past, see <a href="/people/">People</a>.

_Note: In the 2015/16 academic year, I will be on sabbatical in the spring term. To ensure continuity of supervision for students, I will only supervise students as a co-supervisor._
