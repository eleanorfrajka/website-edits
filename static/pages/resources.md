## Tools for Research

*Oceanographic data, analysis and presentation:* I have collected a range of tools for accessing oceanographic data, analysing it, and presenting the results.  These now live at [ObservationalOceanography.com](http://observationaloceanography.com).  I often refer students to this website when they are interested in accessing one of the many publicly available datasets online, whether satellite or hydrography.

## For women in oceanography

Women are under-represented in oceanography, particularly at the more advanced career stages.  There are a few mentoring-type resources available, both of which I've benefited from extensively in different ways.

### MPOWIR
[Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention](http://mpowir.org/) (MPOWIR) – This is a US-based organisation with conferences for women in oceanography, townhall meetings at the AGU Ocean Sciences, and other resources on their website

### ESWN
 [Earth Science Women’s Network](http://eswnonline.org/) – this is an online network open to women around the world in earth science-related disciplines. There are online forums to participate in, a Facebook page, casual dinners at various conferences, etc. It’s a great online community of women, which can be particularly helpful if you’re one of few women in your department or organisation.

## Resources for Teaching

### Flipped learning - making videos

I have been experimenting with 'flipped learning’ ideas in my classes, particularly to teach Matlab to students without any prior programming experience. For this class, I developed a series of podcast-style micro lectures. Since I am a Mac user, I found some tools to create these podcasts using Keynote and Garageband. 
- The process is outlined here: [Creating a Podcast using Keynote](/resources/creating-a-podcast-using-keynote/). 
- If you would additionally like to 'watermark’ your videos, see a method to do that here: [Watermarking in Quicktime](/resources/watermarking-in-quicktime).

### Rotating table practicals 

Both for public outreach and teaching in physical oceanography classes, I use the Weather in a Tank rotating table system. I outline the method we use to record and archive videos of experiments, using a Mac. See here: [Rotating table recordings](/resources/recording-weather-in-a-tank-videos/).

## Opportunities

### for undergraduates

- [Careers in oceanography](/resources/ocean-related-careers/) – Job and career sites, and information about the annual Ocean careers fair at the NOC
- [Summer placement opportunities](resources/summer-placements-for-undergraduates/) for undergraduates at the University of Southampton, within the UK and abroad.
- [Awards for undergrads](/resources/awards-for-undergraduates-and-graduate-students/) – different places you can apply for awards for work you’ve done, or travel awards to go to meetings, etc.

### for graduates

- **PhD projects** at the [Graduate school of the National Oceanography Centre](/people/phd-opportunities/).  The application is typically due in January.

### Postdoctoral opportunities

- **Academic Jobs in the UK**: See the website [jobs.ac.uk](http://jobs.ac.uk) – This is a useful collection of academic jobs in the UK and you can set up e-mail alerts to find jobs of interest to you.
- **Postdoctoral fellowships.** See the page [Join the Group](/people/phd-opportunities/) to find out more about postdoc fellowships for the UK

## Outreach

I am a [STEM Ambassador](http://www.winchestersciencecentre.org/stemnet/stem-ambassadors/#.VWES1GTBzGc), registered with the Hampshire-area ambassadors through the Winchester Science Centre. I am interested in volunteering in science clubs in the Southampton city area. Please contact me if you are interested in outreach possibilities.

I also lecture for the Discover Oceanography programme at Southampton. You can find out more about these opportunities at [http://www.discoveroceanography.co.uk](http://www.discoveroceanography.co.uk/).
