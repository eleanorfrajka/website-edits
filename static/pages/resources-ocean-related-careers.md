## Southampton-specific

**Ocean and Earth Sciences:** For Southampton Ocean and Earth Sciences-specific careers information, see the [OES Careers and Employability page][1].

**For Southampton undergrads:** Find job postings on the SOES Careers page on Blackboard here: [SOES Careers][2].

**Southampton-wide:** For university-wide careers events, you may also want to bookmark the [Career Destinations: Events Calendar][3], which lists when they are running CV clinics, cover letters, interview skills, and more, and the **Career Fairs**, when the employers come to you.

## Online resources: 

Other information online about ocean and marine-related careers and network opportunities:

- **[IMAREST – the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology][4]** has a special network available for young members, including networking opportunities, and a jobs database. There are special membership rates for students, as well as awards and scholarships available.
- **[Ocean Careers (http://oceancareers.com)][5]**  Curious about what types of jobs exist for after you finish an undergraduate degree in an Ocean-related subject? This website describes a lot of them, including experience expected, and what salary you might achieve. Note, however, it’s an American website, so the information may be more relevant to careers in the United States.
