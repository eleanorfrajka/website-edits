## Data, analysis and presentation
I have collected a range of tools for accessing oceanographic data, analysing it, and presenting the results.  These now live at [ObservationalOceanography.com](http://observationaloceanography.com).  I often refer students to this website when they are interested in accessing one of the many publicly available datasets online, whether satellite or hydrography.

## For women in oceanography

Women are under-represented in oceanography, particularly at the more advanced career stages.  There are a few mentoring-type resources available, both of which I've benefited from extensively in different ways.
* [MPOWIR](http://mpowir.org/) (Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention) – This is a US-based organisation with conferences for women in oceanography, townhall meetings at the AGU Ocean Sciences, and other resources on their website
* [ESWN](http://eswnonline.org/) (Earth Science Women’s Network) – this is an online network open to women around the world in earth science-related disciplines. There are online forums to participate in, a Facebook page, casual dinners at various conferences, etc. It’s a great online community of women, which can be particularly helpful if you’re one of few women in your department or organisation.


## Opportunities

### for undergraduates

* [Careers in oceanography](resources/ocean-related-careers/) – Job and career sites, and information about the annual Ocean careers fair at the NOC
* [Summer placement opportunities](resources/summer-placements-for-undergraduates/) for undergraduates at the University of Southampton, within the UK and abroad.
* [Awards for undergrads](resources/awards-for-undergraduates-and-graduate-students/) – different places you can apply for awards for work you’ve done, or travel awards to go to meetings, etc.
