![My helpful screenshot](http://i1.wp.com/www.eleanorfrajka.com/wp-content/uploads/fig3_rapid_3d1-e1432585558370.png){: .callout} This includes the meridional overturning circulation, large-scale heat flux dynamics, origin and fate of mesoscale energy, deep convection, biophysical interactions, and subpolar ocean dynamics. My research methods are centred on ocean observations, with an aim to capitalise on synergies between datatypes. This means using two or more datatypes (satellite, in situ hydrography, moorings or autonomous platforms) to gain a better understanding of ocean dynamics than would be possible from a single data source. In the past, this has required pushing the limits of observational methods, including using satellite data to unravel space-time aliasing of glider data, and developing a method to extract profiles of vertical water velocities from glider hydrographic data.



## Projects

Now spinning up is a new NERC-funded project on Mesoscale eddies in the Atlantic:

* [MerMEED](/projects/mermeed/) (Mechanisms responsible for Mesoscale Eddy Energy Dissipation) - stay tuned for more!

The three main projects I have worked/am working on are

* [DynOPO](/projects/dynopo/) (Dynamics of the Orkney Passage Outflow)
* [RAPID](/projects/rapid/) (Meridional overturning circulation at 26N)
* [Labrador Sea](/projects/labsea/) (Seagliders in the Labrador Sea for my PhD thesis.)


<!--## Methods: Seagliders

A lot of my work has involved using [Seagliders](/projects/seagliders/).

## Smaller-scale interests

While i focus on the large scale circulation, the smaller scales impact this circulation in ways we don’t understand well. We’ve been looking a bit at [eddies and internal waves](/projects/eddies-and-waves/).
