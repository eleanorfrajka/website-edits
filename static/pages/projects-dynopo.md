![Cruise photos, DynOPO JR310](/images/jr310/IMG_6096_thumb.jpg){: .callout} We've completed the first cruise for DynOPO on the RRS James Clark Ross (Mar-Apr 2015).  During the cruise, we successfully deployed 7 enhanced moorings in the Orkney Passage.  See cruise photos at [here](/galleries/jr310/).  The recovery cruise with process study is planned for the southern hemisphere summer season in 2017.  *Stay tuned!*
