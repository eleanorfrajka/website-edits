## Seaglider observations during active convection
![Convection](http://i1.wp.com/www.personal.soton.ac.uk/eefw1u08/researchfigs/horz_web2.png?resize=193%2C210){: .callout} Four of the five Seagliders deployed in the Labrador Sea observed deep convection, with well-mixed water columns down to the depth of observation (1000 m). This offers an unprecedented look at deep convection with horizontal resolution of 10 km {% cite FrajkaWilliams-etal-2014 --prefix post1 %}.


## Seaglider method to extract vertical velocities

![Vertical water velocity](http://i1.wp.com/www.personal.soton.ac.uk/eefw1u08/researchfigs/GLIDER_W.png?resize=193%2C179){: .callout}Vertical water velocity is notoriously difficult to measure, in part because it is so small.  Deep convection offered a unique opportunity to investigate the velocities as estimated using a Seaglider and its hydrodynamic flight model {% cite FrajkaWilliams-etal-2011 --prefix post2 %}. The method is estimated to be accurate to 0.6 cm/s.


## Spring bloom: from space

![Labrador Sea spring bloom](http://i0.wp.com/www.personal.soton.ac.uk/eefw1u08/researchfigs/seawifs_bloom.png?resize=200%2C200){: .callout}The Labrador Sea spring bloom has a distinct pattern: a triangle with centroid over where the 3000m isobath turns westward away from the Greenland shelf. We explain the bloom pattern in terms of haline stratification, and sources of that stratification (mean background flow and eddy transport from the West Greenland Shelf) and analyze interannual relationships between the bloom, runoff from Greenland and eddies {% cite FrajkaWilliams-Rhines-2010 --prefix post3 %}.


## Spring bloom: from Seagliders

![Seaglider observations biophysical](http://i0.wp.com/www.personal.soton.ac.uk/eefw1u08/researchfigs/glider_bloom.png?resize=192%2C182){: .callout}Phytoplankton blooms in the Labrador Sea occur under a variety of distinct physical conditions: in terms of the sources of stratification and the structure of the bloom and hydrography (eddies, fronts and thin layers) {% cite FrajkaWilliams-etal-2009 %}.
