# SOES3010/6005: Large Scale Ocean Processes

This module meets

- Thursdays 1-3pm in Lab T (6th floor, near node 6) for Tutorials

- Fridays 9-11am in Lab T for Lectures

This first week will have a slightly different pattern, so please show up Thursday ready for class.  The last class before Christmas will be Dec 11, and there is class Jan 7 and 8.

**Note:** There are no class meetings in week 6 (so nothing on Nov 5th or Nov 6th) due to Boat Week for the MSc students.  

There are also two computer lab sessions: Tuesday Oct 20 at 2-3pm, and Tuesday Nov 10 at 2-3pm in the ground floor computer lab at NOCS: 121-02.   These are help sessions for a computer practical that is to be completed on your own time.  (More information to come.)

If you are a PhD student and would like to sit in on the class, please e-mail me your username (e.g., mine is eefw1u08) and I'll add you to the Blackboard course as a guest.
