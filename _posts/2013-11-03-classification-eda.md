### Data Storage ###

The post processed data for this experiment are now uploaded to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.  Here are the two binary R data files:

* [classification-full.rda](https://madsen-dissertation.s3.amazonaws.com/experiment-classification/postprocessed-data/classification-full.rda)
* [classification-grouped.rda](https://madsen-dissertation.s3.amazonaws.com/experiment-classification/postprocessed-data/classification-grouped.rda)

And here are the post-processed CSV files (much larger, 4.72GB for the full rows):

* [classification-experiment-neutral-dataset-fullrows.csv](https://madsen-dissertation.s3.amazonaws.com/experiment-classification/postprocessed-data/classification-experiment-neutral-dataset-fullrows.csv)
* [classification-experiment-neutral-dataset-grouped.csv](https://madsen-dissertation.s3.amazonaws.com/experiment-classification/postprocessed-data/classification-experiment-neutral-dataset-grouped.csv)
